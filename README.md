# Vulnerability-Scans-and-Analysis
Utilizing Greenbone Security Assistant, nmap, nikto and wapiti to perform vulnerability scans against Structureality's internal MS10 Windows Server 2016 system and their screened-subnet hosted website. They have given permission to perform the test and provided the IP adress for the MS10 Windows Server 2016 system of 10.1.16.2. 

<h1>Phase 3</h1>


**<p style="font-size: 15px;">Step 1: Configure and run vulnerability scans with GSA.</p>**

*The GVM/GSA tool has already been updated with all of the necessary installations and security feeds.* 

To begin, I elevated the Terminal window to root privileges as I will need the accessibilty it provides in Nmap later on. I followed this by initiating Greenbone Security Assistant, formerly OpenVAS.

I signed into GSA, went to the Configuration tab and selected Targets.

I named the target MS10 and entered the IP Adress for MS10 Windows Server of 10.1.16.2. All other fields remained in their default positions. This scan will be used to show what a non-credentialed vulnerability scan would reveal about their system.

I created a new target with the name MS10-with-creds. I will be performing a credentialed scan utilizing the username and password that I was able to intercept due to the reverse shell on Jaime's system. I created a new credential, in the SMB section of *Credentials for authenticated checks*, using Jaime's username and password, and click yes to allow for inseucre use. This will aid in discovering potentially weak authentication mechanisms.

Next, I clicked on Tasks under the Scans tab to create a new task. I named this task ms10 Scan - no creds and aligned the targe with MS10, the target that did not utilize Jaime's credentials. I left all other fields at their defaults, saved the task, and started the scan which is displayed in the second picture below.

I then created a new task and named it MS10 Scans with creds. This scan is aligned with the MS1-with-creds target to reflect that it will be a credentialed scan. Again, I left all other fields at their defaults, saved the task, and started the scan.

**<p style="font-size: 15px;">Step 2: Perform a vulnerability scan using nmap.</p>**

I returend to the Terminal window with elevated privileges to begin the nmap vulnerability scan. I entered "nmap 10.1.16.2 --script=vuln -vv -sC -sV -O -oN ms10-vuln-scan.txt" which will perform a default SYN scan agaisnt the top 1000 TCP ports, utilize NSE to run the scripts from the vulnerabilities category, run the default scripts from the NSE default category, perform a version scan, identify the operating system and save the output to the file ms10-vuln-scan.txt with the most detail possible.
